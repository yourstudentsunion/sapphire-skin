		<h2>Manifesto Points</h2>
		
		<div class="panel">
		
			<p>Maximising the student experience is something that I strive for every day as Athletics and Cross Country Club Captain and as a member of the Students’ Union Sports Committee. I believe that as Your Students’ Union President, I can bring a balanced, approachable and professional manor to the role, making your campus, a happy campus.</p>
	
			<p>As Students’ Union President I will look to:</p>
	
			<ul>
	
				<li>Integrate recreational opportunities from sports clubs, societies and academic fields to enrich a happy university experience for all</li>
	
				<li>Enhance engagement between FCH, Park, Oxstalls, Hardwick and Pitville to develop the community spirit and create a circle of safety, leading to a happier university</li>
	
				<li>Increase communication so students are more aware of opportunities during enrichment and degree plus weeks, as well as working with the Education Officer to solve timetabling issues</li>
	
			</ul>
	
			<p>Combining both skills from my criminology degree and Students’ Union activity, I am well placed to represent all aspects of the student voice at the University of Gloucestershire.</p>
	
			<p>In my capacity as Athletics and Cross Country Club Captain and as a member of the Students’ Union Sports Committee I have had a positive impact on university sport; giving me confidence that as President I can lead a team that will have a further positive and far reaching impact on the student experience.</p>
